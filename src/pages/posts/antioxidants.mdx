# The What
We always hear that we should get more Antioxidants, but what are they? To understand we must first understand oxidants
## Oxidants - free radicals
as the name suggests, oxidants come from oxidation. oxygen is therefore supprisingly harmful if left unregulated. oxygen species build up naturally as we live and react with cells in your body. This damages your cells, which leaves them in need of repair.

#### case study
This can be seen in stroke victims, where research at the University of Manchester found that lots of the cell damage after a stroke arises from the flow of oxygen after the bloodflow is restored. This study found that stokes that occured in cold environments, reduces the subsequent damage to the brain. This brings us to the first way to clean up these radical oxygen species... cold

### sources of oxidants
- food
- exercise
- light
- heat (Need to check this) 
exercise

## Antioxidants
antioxidants are therefore the snazzy molecules that clean up these pesky free radicals / oxidating agents. You dont have to eat food to get free radicals though.
