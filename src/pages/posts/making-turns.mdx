#### Forewarning disclaimer
This information is crucial for beginners in snowboarding who have mastered the falling leaf technique. If you're not interested in this sport, you might find this note less useful. However, if you're eager to learn, let's dive into making your first turns...

## What are the First Turns in Snowboarding?
The first turns in snowboarding are the next step after mastering the falling leaf technique. They involve linking turns together to smoothly navigate down the slope. This is a crucial skill for any snowboarder as it allows you to control your speed and direction more effectively.

## How to Make Your First Turns in Snowboarding?
To make your first turns, start by initiating a turn just like you would with the falling leaf technique. However, instead of stopping and changing direction, you'll want to smoothly transition into the next turn. This involves shifting your weight from your front foot to your back foot as you turn, and then back to your front foot as you start the next turn. Practice this until you can link turns together smoothly and control your speed effectively.

## Tips for Mastering Your First Turns
1. Keep your body relaxed and your knees slightly bent.
2. Practice shifting your weight between your front and back foot during turns.
3. Start on a gentle slope and gradually move to steeper slopes as you gain confidence.
4. Always wear protective gear, including a helmet and wrist guards.

## Applications of the First Turns in Snowboarding
The first turns are a fundamental snowboarding skill that all snowboarders use, from beginners to professionals. They allow you to navigate down the slope smoothly and control your speed effectively. They're also crucial for navigating through tight trees or when the slope gets too steep.
