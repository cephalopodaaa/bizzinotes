This is a real simple tool that is used by Molecular Biologists worldwide. It's a way to separate DNA fragments by size. It's a pretty simple concept, but it's a really powerful tool. It's used in a lot of different ways, but the most common use is to check the size of DNA fragments after they've been cut with restriction enzymes.

## How it works
The basic idea is that you have a gel that's made of a material that's kind of like jello. You put the DNA fragments at one end of the gel, and then you apply an electric field to the gel. The DNA fragments are negatively charged, so they move towards the positive end of the gel. The smaller fragments move faster than the larger fragments, so they end up further down the gel.

## How to do it
To do gel electrophoresis, you need a few things:
- A gel that's made of a material that's kind of like jello
- A way to apply an electric field to the gel
- DNA fragments that you want to separate
- A way to see the DNA fragments after they've been separated

The gel is usually made of a material called agarose, which is a kind of sugar that's extracted from seaweed. The gel is poured into a mold, and then a comb is used to make wells in the gel. The DNA fragments are mixed with a dye that makes them visible, and then they're loaded into the wells. The gel is then placed in a tank that's filled with a buffer solution, and electrodes are attached to the gel. When the electric field is applied, the DNA fragments move through the gel, and the smaller fragments move faster than the larger fragments.

After the DNA fragments have been separated, they need to be visualized. This is usually done by staining the gel with a dye that binds to the DNA fragments. The gel is then placed under a UV light, and the DNA fragments show up as bands on the gel.

## Applications
Gel electrophoresis is used in a lot of different ways in molecular biology. One of the most common uses is to check the size of DNA fragments after they've been cut with restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes are enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences, and they're used in a lot of different ways in molecular biology. Gel electrophoresis is also used to separate DNA fragments for cloning, sequencing, and other applications.
