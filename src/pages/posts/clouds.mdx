##### **“Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud's blowed from or who the soul'll be 'morrow?”**

So without further-a-do, let talk about the different types of clouds your might encounter through life
<br />
## Cumulus clouds
large, fluffy clouds that often look like fair-weather clouds. They are usually white or gray and have a distinct, rounded shape.

## Stratus clouds
low, flat clouds that often cover the entire sky. They are usually gray or white and can sometimes produce a light mist or drizzle.

## Cirrus clouds
thin, wispy clouds that are made up of ice crystals. They are often high in the sky and appear white or very pale in color.

## Cumulonimbus clouds
large, towering clouds that are associated with thunderstorms. They often have a dark, ominous appearance and can produce heavy rain, hail, lightning, and strong winds.

## Alto clouds
medium-level clouds that form between 6,500 and 20,000 feet above the ground. They include clouds such as altostratus and altocumulus.

## Nimbostratus clouds
low-level clouds that produce continuous rain or snow. They often have a thick, gray appearance and can obscure the sun or other objects in the sky.
