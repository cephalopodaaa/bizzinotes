# intro
Sooooo, I went to the dentist today and they gave me lots of useful information about how best to keep healthy teeth and gums. The thing I found most useful was that they shared WHY all the things are imporant and what they aim to achieve. So I'm partially writing this so I remember, but also thought you bizzi peoples might be interested too!

# key points
- Hydrate - dry mouth allows bacteria to stick to your teeth and gums
- Floss after brushing but before spitting the toothpaste - This allows the floss to bring the toothpaste down between the teeth
- warm salty water - helps reduce gum inflammation and good for general gum health
- oil pulling with coconut oil - I thought this was a fad, apparently does nothing for killing bacteria like claims say, but does keep teeth more slippery which prevents the bacteria from being able to stick to the teeth throughout the day.
p
- 30 min rule - don't brush 30 mins before or after eating. especially after as you brush all the acids / enzymes around your teeth which can lead to decay.


# proposed schedule
## morning
optional: mouthwash first
1. Brush teeth - ideally dont' rinse
2. wait 30 mins - allows floride to sink into teeth
optional: oil pull with coconut oil to keep your mouth resistant to bacteria throughout the day

## evening
1. Brush teeth - dont spit!
2. Floss



# notes on flossing options - Water flossers, Handled floss, and line floss
Apparently there is no comparison to the string floss. you have more control and more surface to use against the teeth. the floss with a handle comes in close second as it can help people with less dexterity. The problem with water floss is that it wont get the bits that are really stuck in there, so the dentist recommended that people who use water flossers should also use regular floss every 3 or 4 days. It was described as a 'fun toy', but I guess if it gets people to floss more than they usually would, I guess its better than nothing :)

# The Science
But why care for your teeth? Surely this is why we have dentists?

well, recent research has found that oral health can affect brain health. Specifically the gum health. Will add a bit more info on this one I have looked over the litterature myself and made my own assessements, but this does seem like it could be quite a big factor in maintaining a healthy brain into later life.
