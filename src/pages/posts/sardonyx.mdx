### Sardonyx
- A variety of chalcedony, a cryptocrystalline form of quartz
- Known for its distinctive banded pattern of alternating white and reddish-brown layers
- Highly prized for its beauty and rarity in the ancient world

## Sardonyx in History and Folklore

#### Ancient Symbolism and Significance
- In ancient Greece, sardonyx was associated with the goddess Aphrodite and was believed to bring happiness and marital bliss
- The Romans believed sardonyx could protect against evil spirits and grant courage to soldiers
- In ancient India, sardonyx was considered a sacred stone and was often used in religious ceremonies and rituals

- Sardonyx cameos were particularly popular in ancient Rome, where they were often carved with portraits of emperors and mythological figures
- The Egyptians revered sardonyx and believed it had the power to bring good luck and protection against negative energies

## The Chemistry of Sardonyx

#### Composition and Structure
- Sardonyx is a form of chalcedony, which is a cryptocrystalline variety of quartz (SiO₂)
- The distinctive banded pattern is created by the alternating layers of different iron oxide impurities
- The white layers are formed by pure chalcedony, while the reddish-brown layers contain inclusions of iron oxides such as hematite (Fe₂O₃) or goethite (FeO(OH))

#### Formation and Occurrence
- Sardonyx is formed through the deposition of silica-rich fluids in cavities or voids within igneous or sedimentary rocks
- The alternating bands are created by fluctuations in the concentration of iron oxides during the deposition process
- Major sources of sardonyx include India, Brazil, Uruguay, and the United States (Arizona and Oregon)

#### Physical Properties
- Hardness: 6.5 - 7 on the Mohs scale
- Luster: Waxy to vitreous
- Specific Gravity: 2.6 - 2.7
- Refractive Index: 1.54 - 1.55
