# waxing your stick
gotta get that board sticky!

diz

##intro
Its helps a bunch if your board is well waxed. sometimes you buy a board and its already got a decent amount of wax on it, so in those cases its normally worth just picking up a 'all purpose' wax for your temperature conditions and waxing it up.

If however, you feel like it needs a fresh coat, or you just bought a brand spanking new board in all its shiny glory, well then, you're both in the right place :P

## Removing wax
The easiest way to do this is by putting your board in the sun and let it melt it a bit, then with some kitchen roll, wipe off that pesky wax.


## board position
If you have a longboard with a fixed fin, you'll want to find somewhere you can position it over the edge so it lays flat, you'll have to push down hard when applying the wax so you want it on a soft and even surface. 


## first base coat - get creative
Get some nice patterns going. will  e helpful to see when your top coat has fully removed and you're back to just the base coat.


## second base coat - use that elbow grease
stick to the creative patterns you layed down initially. 

## First top coat - Easy does it
now go over it in your top wax. This is usually a specific type of wax that is indended to go over a base coat.
