# The Notes:
Organisational tunes to get you motivated!


# The Reading:
to get the essence of this book. Skip to pages: 

# The Message:
Organise folder system for all digital locations with:
- 1-Projects
- 2-Areas
- 3-Resources
- 4-Archive
- 5-Inbox
These catagories are pretty self explanatory, but to elaborate:
- 1-Projects
Anything you are actively working on and has a clear deadline
- 2-Areas
Areas you are actively responsible for but without a deadline
- 3-Resources
Resources are essentially 'Areas' that you are not actively involved in. They are likely to become 'Projects' or 'Areas' at somepoint in the near future
- 4-Archive
Archive is where you dump all completed projects and areas. It can have all your old pictures. This folder doesnt need to be tidy
- 5-Inbox
This is where you dumpt all of the incoming files/folders that you have not decided in which folder they belong. This should prevent any of the folders from becoming messy.
