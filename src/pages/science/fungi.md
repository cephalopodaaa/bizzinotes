Saccharomyces cerevisiae: This fungus, also known as baker's yeast, is a model organism that is widely used in the study of genetics, cell biology, and biotechnology. It is used to produce bread, beer, and other fermented products, and has been used to produce a number of biopharmaceuticals including vaccines and enzymes.

Aspergillus niger: This fungus is a common contaminant of food and is often used in the production of enzymes, including those used in the food and beverage industry. It is also used in the production of a number of other products including antibiotics, organic acids, and flavors.

Penicillium chrysogenum: This fungus is the source of the antibiotic penicillin, which is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is also used in the production of a number of other products including cheese, citric acid, and enzymes.

Fusarium oxysporum: This fungus is a plant pathogen that causes diseases in a number of crops including tomatoes, peppers, and bananas. It is studied in order to understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity and to develop strategies for managing and controlling fungal diseases in plants.

Candida albicans: This fungus is a common cause of infections in humans, including yeast infections and thrush. It is studied in order to understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity and to develop strategies for preventing and treating fungal infections.
