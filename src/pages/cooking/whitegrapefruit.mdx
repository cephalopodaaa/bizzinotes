musictext: a get up and go playlist with that citrusy twang... think bluegrass... but lemongrass
sciencetext: okay grapefruit do pack a punch so there is a few bits of science I need to lay down. Grapefruit is known to interfere with lots of medication, including the contraceptive pill. A rudamentary explanation of how it does this, is by inhibitting the enzyme that normally breaks down this medication so it lasts for longer in your system.
