foodtext: watch the gif for all the info on how to cook these eggs without needing to do the flip. It'll change your life! (... okay maybe not, but its cool, ok?)
musictext: Frazzly Friday tunes, also works for sunday chills after a big night. nothing too abrasive, hear the healing
sciencetext: so eggs have all kinda good stuff in them. The main ones are Choline and Biotin which are particularly hard to get in other foods. Eggs also are reasonably high in protein but not too many carbs. There is controversy about whether eating more than 3 yolks is bad for you but I shall research this more later
