the Notes came down from out of spaces. Its still unknown what they are but the seem to embody a paticular flavour of music. This music cannot be confined to a genre, just like you cant confine a sweet taste to just breakfasts. the Notes will pop up in all sorts of genres, although they tend to have a dominant genre in most cases.. genre in a loosely defined way.

and now the essence of the site.

the iea of bizzinotes is that it mainly provides playlists for every situation, the lure of life, and a musical education like no others. why gatekeep music, all the good songs I know have come from other people. I'm just a humble guy wanting to share some tunes and science in his own querky way. anyways the idea is that you can pick out a playlist or the esact situation, save playlists in your saved tab and wip them out when you feel most like it. learn more about the bands with an easy guide. can maybe get an API for bands so that the bands can be clicked and more information can be seen in .

the idea of having playlists for social situation means it can easily spread by word of mouth

further down the line I may need to get a web designer to finish it off,
